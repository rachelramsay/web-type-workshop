	<h1>Makin&#8217; a Website Doesn't Suck Anymore</h1>
	<h2>1997 vs 2023</h2>
	<p>Websites are more fun to make in 2023. I <em>hated</em> making websites in 1997.</p>
	<h4>1997 Facts</h4>
	<ol>
	<li>
		Limited Design Freedom: Designers had limited control over layout and visual elements due to the dominance of table-based layouts and the lack of advanced CSS support. This resulted in rigid, grid-like designs.
	</li>

	<li>
		Browser Compatibility Issues: Designers had to account for compatibility issues between Netscape Navigator
		and Internet Explorer, leading to extra work to ensure that websites looked consistent across different
		browsers.
	</li>

	<li>
		Slow Internet Speeds: Most users had slow dial-up internet connections, making it difficult to incorporate rich
	media, high-quality images, or interactive features, limiting design possibilities.
</li>
<li>
Primitive Graphics: Designers were restricted to using primitive graphics tools, resulting in low-quality images
	and animations that often looked unprofessional.
</li>

	<li>Lack of Typography Control: Fine-tuning typography was challenging, as designers had limited font choices, and
	text rendering varied widely between browsers.
</li>

	<li>No Responsive Design: The concept of responsive web design did not exist, making it challenging to create
	websites that adapted to various screen sizes and resolutions.
	</li>

	<li>Limited Interactivity: JavaScript was in its infancy, so designers had limited options for creating interactive
		and dynamic elements on web pages.
	</li>

	<li>No Content Management Systems (CMS): Websites were typically static, and designers had to manually update
		content, making the maintenance process cumbersome and time-consuming.
	</li>
	<li>Geocities and Template Designs: Many designers felt frustrated by the proliferation of amateurish websites on
		platforms like Geocities, where generic templates were prevalent.
	</li>
	
	<li>Lack of Design Standards: There were no well-established design standards or best practices for web design,
	leading to inconsistency and experimentation in design approaches.
	</li>	<li>
		Slow Load Times: Heavy use of images and animated GIFs often led to slow page load times, frustrating users and
	affecting the overall user experience.

	</li>	
	
	<li> Accessibility Challenges: Web accessibility was not a priority, making it difficult for designers to ensure that
	websites were accessible to individuals with disabilities.
	</li>

	<li>Limited Feedback: Without modern analytics tools, designers had limited access to user feedback and data to
	inform their design decisions.
	</li>
